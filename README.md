- Possibilities of unique fund configuration. and the smart contract nature of our solution. will allow us to give large investors. the ability to create unique funds. with an implemented specific investing strategy
- Creating a market for large crypto holders, where we can setup and OTC between different large portfolio holders and exchanges. This will create a large pool of liquidity for both of them.
